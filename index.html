                    <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>
                    <p>
                        I decided to do my final project as an interpretive video. I went through "Blue Cathedral" and kept track of common motifs, moods, melodies, etc. I then used Adobe Premier to splice together Youtube videos that represented my interpretation of the music.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I also created this blog website. I wrote Javascript code so that I can reference a section of the song which you can play by clicking. Try it <sup class="player">3:14-3:18</sup>.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Video Walkthrough</h2>
                    <p> 
                        At the beginning of the piece <sup class="player">0:00-0:14</sup> we hear faint bells. Their notes linger and build on top of each other to create harmony. I decided to visualize this with colored water droplets, stacking multiple videos which add on to each other. 
                    </p>

                    <p> 
                        These water droplets can also express the mood or represent a motif. For example, the red water droplet appears at times where the music feels militaristic, such as <sup class="player">3:10-3:15</sup>. We hear imposing brass instruments playing in a minor scale. It resembles other military-like / march music we’ve studied, such as Beethoven’s ‘Eroica’ or Mahler’s “Wo Die Schönen Trompeten Blasen.” While neither of these pieces are explicitly considered military music, we’ve connected “Eroica” to a triumphant narrative about Napoleon and have learned about how Mahler’s compositions were affected by him growing up near military bases. I also use the red water droplet at times where the melody spikes to be very high pitched, such as <sup class="player">1:06-1:11</sup> or <sup class="player">3:14-3:18</sup>. This is usually played by the flute or strings. 
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        After the bells subside, the strings start to play a sighing pattern, playing two alternating notes. This ties in well to the water droplets, which have a long upwards trail after they first land in the water. The water droplets represent the quick sudden bell sounds opening up for the long, reaching strings melody.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The section after this starts with a solo flute playing a slow, high pitched melody. It is accompanied by strings that make the same sighing pattern, visualized again with droplets. I decided to visualize this section as a river because I wanted a way to show the progression of this piece from start to finish. The video is split into three “river” sections: the mid-day river, which introduces melodies, the dusk river, where the energy of the piece climaxes, and the night-time river, where the piece comes to a slow end. I also did it to reference the intentions of the composer. In her own words:
                    
                    <blockquote>
                        I began writing this piece at a unique juncture in my life and found myself pondering the question of what makes a life. The recent loss of my younger brother, Andrew Blue, made me reflect on the amazing journeys that we all make in our lives, crossing paths with so many individuals singularly and collectively, learning and growing each step of the way. This piece represents the expression of the individual and the group... our inner travels and the places our souls carry us, the lessons we learn, and the growth we experience. In tribute to my brother, I feature solos for the clarinet (the instrument he played) and the flute (the instrument I play). Because I am the older sibling, it is the flute that appears first in this dialog. At the end of the work, the two instruments continue their dialogue, but it is the flute that drops out and the clarinet that continues on in the upward progressing journey.
                    </blockquote>

                        I see this as similar to Chopin’s “Ballade” because while they’re program music, they are trying to portray an abstract concept rather than a specific one. For example, Liszt’s “Sposalizio” is meant to represent a specific wedding from a Raphael painting, while Chopin’s “Ballade” is only meant to convey the abstract idea of a bard telling a tale. Higdon aimed to represent the different journeys through life from start to finish, which still allowed her program music to have a free range of interpretability. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        At <sup class="player">1:36-1:45</sup> we hear a melody, first played by flute, then strings. It holds one note for a long time while another instrument plays around it. The melody of the other instrument moves in step but remains relatively constant. I visualized this with flying birds, who both “glide” like the constant note and “flap” like the moving melody. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        A crescendo starts at <sup class="player">3:04-3:10</sup> which gives way to the aforementioned militaristic brass melody <sup class="player">3:14-3:23</sup>. A clarinet melody goes from a major key to a minor key <sup class="player">4:30-4:45</sup> and sounds slightly more dissonant. At <sup class="player">5:30-5:35</sup> we hear a very high pitched flute melody, which I visualized as a crying child. This melody is quickly accompanied by a low-pitched cello and clarinet, which I represented as an adult coming to cradle the baby. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        After a repeat of the militaristic theme, we hear a trumpet melody moving up and down in step very quickly <sup class="player">8:15-8:25</sup>. The melody is repetitive and the trumpets simply go up and down the scale, reversing direction each time they complete it. That’s why I visualized it as a man going up and down stairs with the video occasionally playing in reverse.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        At <sup class="player">9:41-10:00</sup> there are very few instruments playing. Mostly, it is a solo flute or strings. I visualized this as a lone dancer. The piece then quiets down into a slow end, which I portrayed as the final nighttime river fading to black.
                    </p>
